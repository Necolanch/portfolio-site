# Nicholas Cruz Portfolio

Welcome to the repo for my personal portfolio website. In my portfolio you will find a few sections that hold some personal information about myself, work experience I have, project information for things I have created, and various ways to contact and stay in touch with me. My design and layout was inspired by Brittany Chiang and her portfolio. I attempted to recreate a similar layout with my own flow and without using her published source code for her portfolio. I created my portfolio with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no frameworks of any kind. I felt it was simple enough to do so without any.
