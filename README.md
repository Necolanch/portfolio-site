# Nicholas Cruz Portfolio

Welcome to the repo for my personal portfolio website. I began creating this locally without uploading to Github. In hindsight I realize that may not have been the best idea, but with only have learned the basics of everything front-end within the last 8 months my confidence is hindered compared to what my skills may display. Now that I have it up, I will be pushing the updates I make to show more of my workflow.

In my portfolio you will find a few sections that hold some personal information about myself, work experience I have, project information for things I have created, and various ways to contact and stay in touch with me. My design and layout was inspired by Brittany Chiang and her portfolio. I attempted to recreate a similar layout with my own flow and without using her published source code for her portfolio. I created my portfolio with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no frameworks of any kind. I felt it was simple enough to do so without any.
